/// The interface that represents a JSON value.
/// 
/// Instances of `JsonValue` are immutable and thread safe.
/// 
/// A `JsonValue` can be produced by {@link Json#parse(String)} or {@link
/// Json#fromUntyped(Object)}. See {@link #toString()}  for converting a `JsonValue`
/// to its corresponding JSON String.
/// 
/// ## Example
/// ```java
/// List<Object> values = Arrays.asList("foo", true, 25);
/// JsonValue json = Json.fromUntyped(values);
/// json.toString(); // returns "[\"foo\",true,25]"
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Pattern Matching
/// ```java
/// JsonValue value = Json.parse(jsonString);
/// switch (value) {
///     case JsonObject obj -> processObject(obj);
///     case JsonArray arr -> processArray(arr);
///     case JsonString str -> processString(str);
///     case JsonNumber num -> processNumber(num);
///     case JsonBoolean bool -> processBoolean(bool);
///     case JsonNull n -> processNull();
/// }
/// ```
///
/// A class implementing a non-sealed `JsonValue` sub-interface must adhere
/// to the following:
/// - The class's implementations of `equals`, `hashCode`,
///   and `toString` compute their results solely from the values
///   of the class's instance fields (and the members of the objects they
///   reference), not from the instance's identity.
/// - The class's methods treat instances as *freely substitutable*
///   when equal, meaning that interchanging any two instances `x` and
///   `y` that are equal according to `equals()` produces no
///   visible change in the behavior of the class's methods.
/// - The class performs no synchronization using an instance's monitor.
/// - The class does not provide any instance creation mechanism that promises
///   a unique identity on each method callâ€”in particular, any factory
///   method's contract must allow for the possibility that if two independently-produced
///   instances are equal according to `equals()`, they may also be
///   equal according to `==`.
///
/// Users of `JsonValue` instances should ensure the following:
/// - When two instances of `JsonValue` are equal (according to `equals()`), users
///   should not attempt to distinguish between their identities, whether directly via reference
///   equality or indirectly via an appeal to synchronization, identity hashing,
///   serialization, or any other identity-sensitive mechanism.
/// - Synchronization on instances of `JsonValue` is strongly discouraged,
///   because the programmer cannot guarantee exclusive ownership of the
///   associated monitor.
///
/// @since 99

    /// JSON element, except that the returned string does not contain any white
    /// spaces or newlines to produce a compact representation.
    /// For a String representation suitable for display, use
