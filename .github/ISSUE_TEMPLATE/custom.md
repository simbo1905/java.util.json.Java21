> "Please review README.md along with this issue description and check that it: clearly explains the problem or request, provides sufficient context, includes relevant details, and aligns with project standards."

If you used an AI assistant while preparing this issue, ensure it followed the contributor/agent workflow rules in `AGENTS.md`.
