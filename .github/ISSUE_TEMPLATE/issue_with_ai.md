# Augmented Intelligence (AI) Welcomed

AI as **Augmented Intelligence** is most welcome here. Contributions that enhance *human + agent collaboration* are encouraged. If you want to suggest new agent‑workflows, prompt patterns, or improvements in tooling / validation / introspection, please submit amendments to **AGENTS.md** via standalone PRs. Your ideas make the difference.

When submitting Issues or PRs, please use a "deep research" tool to sanity check your proposal. Then before submission run your draft through a strong model with a prompt such as:

> "Please review the AGENTS.md and README.md along with this draft PR/Issue and check that it does not have any gaps — why it might be insufficient, incomplete, lacking a concrete example, duplicating prior issues or PRs, or not be aligned with the project goals or non‑goals."

Please attach the output of that model's review to your Issue or PR.
