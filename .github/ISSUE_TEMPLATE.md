(Optional) When submitting an Issue, please consider using a "deep research" tool to sanity check your proposal. Then **before** submission, run your draft through a strong model with a prompt such as:

> "Please review README.md along with this draft Issue and check that it does not have any gaps — why it might be insufficient, incomplete, lacking a concrete example, duplicating prior issues or PRs, or not be aligned with the project goals or non‑goals."

If you used an AI assistant while preparing this Issue, ensure it followed the contributor/agent workflow rules in `AGENTS.md`.

(Optional)  Please then attach both the prompt and the model's review to the bottom of this template under "Augmented Intelligence Review".
